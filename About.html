            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata. It is a conversation between prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. Set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra just before the start of a great war, the Bhagavad Gita addresses the moral and philosophical dilemmas faced by Arjuna.</p>
    <p>The Gita covers various aspects of life, duty (dharma), righteousness, devotion, and the path to spiritual realization (moksha). It is revered by Hindus as a sacred scripture and a guide to leading a righteous and meaningful life. The teachings of the Bhagavad Gita transcend religious boundaries and have been appreciated by people of diverse backgrounds worldwide for its timeless wisdom and profound insights into the human condition.</p>
